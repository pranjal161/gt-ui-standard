/**
 * Displays content in tabbed view for route '/viewTab'. 
 * The tabs are displayed in component SecondaryTabs, tab content is displayed here.
 * Only one tab can be active at one time, and only its content will be visible.
 * Tabs hide the content with a simple css rule - display: "none". This means that tab content which is a React component is not rerendered, just hidden.
 * This way the state of each React component that is being displayed or hidden, is preserved during tab selection. 
 * Otherwise, on each tab reselect the tab content would revert to its initial state, losing all user made changes that were not saved.
 * Tabs can also be closed to be removed from the tabbed view, and can be dynamically added, without rerendering already added tabs and their content.
 * The component doesn't seem to increase memory usage much - the app starts with a memory use of about 17-18 MB, and opening 4 tabs 
 * containing TicketView components causes an initial bump to about 25 MB, and this is about 1 minute later reduced to about 19-20 MB.
 * Opening 4 tabs containing ContractView components causes an initial bump to about 70 MB, and this is about 1 minute later reduced to about 19-20 MB.
 * Re-renders are optimized to try to keep them to just what is necessary.
