# Typography
Use typography to present your design and content as clearly and efficiently as possible.

> See : https://material-ui.com/components/typography/#typography


## In CSS frameworks components

**For Material**, the typography is overrided by a theme.
> theme.typography

Material components will use correctly the typography according their own rules (size/bold/italic).

**For Cdk**, for now, we can't override the typography, we have only "Open Sans", "sans-serif" fonts.

## Outside CSS frameworks components

Related to the xd Design, we have a list of variant to use : https://xd.adobe.com/view/c8a8aa8e-bcc3-4507-a7c8-b5209c1ae61c-9dfb/variables/

### Project variants
- titleSection
- subTitleSection
- body
- secondaryBody
- link
- tab
- placeholder

For the moment we can't add these variants to the material variant list : https://material-ui.com/api/typography/

### `<Typo/>` component
The solution is to use the `<Typo/>` component with our project variants.

> See stories of `<Typo/>`


## Specific typography outside variants

As we are not going to create new variants for all the variations of typography, the solution is to use the theme typography is to make the modification locally in your component.

You must use the theme.typography. It is available using material's makeStyle:
```jsx
const useStyles = makeStyles((theme) => ({
    root:{
        fontFamily: theme.typography.fontFamily,
        fontSize:'8px',
        fontStyle:'italic',
        color: theme.palette.text.primary,
        fontWeight:'normal',
        letterSpacing: '0px'
    }}))
```
